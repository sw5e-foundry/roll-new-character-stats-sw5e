Rolling attributes in the Foundry system can be a bit cumbersome depending on what method is used. Whether you are completely writing out the /roll formulas, clicking on sets of dice multiple times and applying your method consistently accross new players in your campaign - the process to get a new character's attributes can take time away from play. 

Some folks are okay with this, as it adds to the suspense of creating a new character, however, for those who just can't wait to get to the game - and want a new set of stats now - Roll New Character Stats does just that. 

DM's and Players can locate the dice icon in their token selection toolbar. Simply click the dice, confirm and see results presented in the chat log. Players with Create Actor permission may click the Configure Actor button to configure the new actor based on the rules set by the DM.
